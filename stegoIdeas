Easy 1. Storing the encoded flag inside of the file metadata

Easy / Medium. Appending a rar file to the end of a .jpg
  The rar file can be read if the jpg is opened with winrar / windows explorer etc...
  
  Make it a medium flag by encrypting the rar with a shitty password from rockyou.txt
    Force them to use fcrackzip or john to crack, unsure of the feasibility of this one

Hard? Spiral of pretty colors
      spiral where the RGB codes decode to an encoded flag, encoded as follows:
          RC3{flag-goes-here}
          base64 Encode
          ASCII to Binary
          base64 Encode
          RGB spiral encoding
          
      This brings the flag out to a few thousand characters, forces scripting. 
      (could also use morse code to avoid double base64)
     
     
Definitely Hard. Piet Code that prints a script.
      Pretty obscure knowledge, would be time consuming to find?
     

Hard Bonus Flag:
      We give them an encrypted data set, with a vague hint leading to Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm 
      
      Basically we can encrypt the data set with the flags, and set the encryption to only require x/? keys,
      to reward them for figuring out and implementing shamirs algo, but requiring the solving of previous challenges
      
Bonus Flag similar to above, but requiring all of the flags, including the previous one.
